 Hackathon Track: Clearly state which of the four tracks you are
competing in (e.g., Onchain Finance & RWA).

Provide a deployment link to your application and crucially, a Test
Hedera Account ID + private key with a small amount of t‚Ñè for the
judges to interact with the working Proof of Concept (PoC) or MVP.

Clearly state which of the four tracks you are competing in (e.g.,
Onchain Finance & RWA). Teams must submit for only one track.

This document provides highly detailed instructions for the four mandatory components required for your
final project submission. Adherence to these specifics is crucial for eligibility and ensures that the judging
panel can accurately and efficiently assess your project s Technology Readiness Level (TRL), technical
execution on the Hedera network, and potential for real-world application in the African context.
submit a complete, verifiable package that enables instant clarity for the judges on your project s value,
implementation, and future viability.
Mandatory Requirements:

Project Name, Team Name, and a
one sentence, powerful value
proposition.
Define the specific problem. Use
verifiable, quantitative data. Explain
why this problem is currently
unsolvable or inefficiently solved.

MANDATORY: Beyond speed and
cost, detail how Hedera s unique
features (e.g., ABFT finality, low,
predictable fees, governance
structure, ESG credentials) are a
competitive advantage necessary
for success.
Define your target customer/user
segment. Quantify the market size
(Total, Serviceable, Obtainable
Market). Include local market
insights.
High level diagram. Highlight the
Hedera integration points. 
State your self-assessed TRL
Level (Ideation, Prototype, or
MVP) (optional)

How does the project generate
revenue? Specify who pays, what
the pricing mechanism is (fiat or
token), and the financial flow.
What have you quantifiably
achieved during the hackathon?
(e.g., GitHub commits, users
onboarded during testing, mentor
feedback, key Hedera features
implemented).
Highlight core members relevant
skills (Web3, domain expertise,
previous hackathon experience)
and why your team is uniquely
qualified to execute this in the
African market.
Next 3-6 month plan (post
hackathon, focusing on Mainnet
launch, first pilot, etc.). What is
your specific Ask ? (e.g.,
Mentorship in X area, specific
grant funding amount, introduction
to Y corporate partner).
If using a token: detail its utility,
total supply, distribution model
(e.g., vesting, team allocation), and
its role in governance/incentivizing
network growth. 

If no token, detail your community
growth strategy.
Introduce your product/dApp.
Include clear screenshots/
mockups. Explain how
decentralization/DLT provides a
fundamental, trustless advantage.
Key Details to Include
You must submit ONE single GitHub repository link that serves as the
complete technical blueprint for your project. This repository must adhere to
software development best practices, ensure the code is publicly auditable,
and contain all necessary documentation. 
Private repositories are an immediate disqualification.

P ublic Visibility: 
The entire source code must be hosted on a public GitHub repository. Ensure all
branches are accessible.

 (The Project Blueprint) Required Sections: 
This document must provide all information needed for a judge or mentor to set
up and run your project in under 10 minutes. It must include:
 Project Title & Track.
 Hedera Integration Summary (Detailed): 
A dedicated, concise paragraph for each Hedera service used, explaining the
why (e.g., "We chose HCS for immutable logging of critical supply chain events because its
predictable $0.0001 fee guarantees operational cost stability, which is essential for lowmargin logistics in Africa."). 
This should be further detailed with:

Transaction Types: 

List the specific Hedera transactions executed 

(e.g., ).

Economic Justification: 

Explain how Hedera s low, predictable fees, high throughput, or ABFT finality directly
support the project s financial sustainability and user adoption in Africa.
 Deployment & Setup Instructions: 
Clear, bulleted, and step by step instructions on how to clone the repo, install
dependencies, configure environment variables, and run the project locally on
Hedera Testnet.

Running Environment: Specify the expected local running state (e.g.,
 to launch the React frontend on and
for the backend. ).

 Architecture Diagram (Mandatory): A simple diagram (e.g., ASCII art or a
simple linked image) showing the data flow between your Frontend (UI), Backend/
Smart Contracts, and the Hedera network/Mirror Nodes. The diagram must explicitly
label the flow of data to and from Hedera.
 Deployed Hedera IDs: List all key IDs used in the Testnet deployment (e.g.,
Smart Contract IDs, HTS Token IDs, HCS Topic IDs, key Hedera Account IDs).

Security & Secrets (Critical): DO NOT commit any private keys, files, or
sensitive credentials.

Example Configuration: Use example configuration files ( ) showing
the structure of required variables.

Judge Credentials: Instruct the judges in your DoraHacks submission notes on
how to securely access any required test credentials (e.g., Test account ID and
Private Key are provided in the DoraHacks submission text field for verification. ).

Code Quality: Utilize clear function names, consistent styling, and include inline
comments where logic is complex, ensuring the code is easily auditable by
technical judges.

 Auditability: Ensure the core logic files ( ) are clean. Projects
using linters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) and a standardized commit history will be noted
positively.

Required Slide Breakdown (Web3 Fundamentals):
Fo cus on PoC: The video must showcase a working proof of concept (PoC)
or prototype, demonstrating at least the core Hedera integrated feature. 

Do not use static mockups for this section.
The pitch deck should be a maximum of 12 20 slides (PDF or PPT format) and
must clearly articulate your project s business viability, market fit, and deep
understanding of the Web3 landscape.
The judging process uses the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) framework to
ensure projects are evaluated fairly based on their maturity.
Pure ideation, mock ups, or wireframes are not eligible. All projects must submit
functional code that successfully executes at least one verifiable transaction on
the Hedera Testnet to pass the initial compliance gate.
I deation (TRL 1 3) / Proof of Concept (PoC) Minimum:

Code Requirement: The repository must contain deployable code
demonstrating a single core Hedera Testnet transaction (e.g., HTS creation
or HCS submission).

Focus: The primary scoring emphasis is on the Innovation, Problem
Statement, and Market Fit.

Prototype (TRL 4 6) / Working Core Feature:

Code Requirement: End to end working feature and display the transaction
hash viewed on a Hedera Mirror Node Explorer.

Focus: The primary scoring emphasis (35%) is on Technical Execution,
reliability, and architectural depth of Hedera Service utilization.
Final Compliance Checklist (Gate 1):
All team members are registered on DoraHacks.

At least one team member is Hedera Certified (proof provided).

A single, public GitHub repository link is provided.

GitHub README.md includes full setup instructions and Hedera Integration
Summary.
Demonstration Video (Max 3 mins) showing a live Hedera transaction is linked.
Pitch Deck (Max 20 slides) addressing all Web3 fundamentals is uploaded.
