
  🗄️ 1. Evidence Data Structure

  Database Schema (evidence-schema.sql):
  evidence_submissions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    market_id VARCHAR (references approved_markets),
    user_id VARCHAR,
    evidence_text TEXT,
    evidence_links TEXT[],
    submission_fee DECIMAL(15,8), -- HBAR amount
    transaction_id VARCHAR,       -- Hedera transaction ID
    status VARCHAR (pending|reviewed|accepted|rejected),
    quality_score DECIMAL(3,2),   -- Admin rating 0-5.0
    admin_notes TEXT,
    reward_amount DECIMAL(15,8),
    created_at, reviewed_at, updated_at
  )

  Key Findings:
  - ❌ No stance tracking - doesn't track if evidence
  supports/disputes the claim
  - ✅ Admin approval system via status field
  - ✅ Quality scoring system (0-5.0 scale)
  - ✅ Hedera integration with transaction IDs and HBAR rewards       

  🤖 2. AI Analysis Storage

  Current Structure (stored in approved_markets.resolution_data):    
  ai_resolution: {
    recommendation: 'YES' | 'NO' | 'INCONCLUSIVE',
    confidence: number (0-1),
    reasoning: string,
    keyFactors: string[],
    sourceAnalysis: { [source]: { position, summary } },
    sourceArticles: Article[],
    dataSourceUsed: 'NEWS' | 'HISTORICAL' | 'ACADEMIC' |
  'GENERAL_KNOWLEDGE',
    processingTimeMs: number
  }

  Key Findings:
  - ✅ Individual article analysis stored in sourceAnalysis
  - ✅ Source-specific routing with data source type tracking
  - ✅ Full article details preserved for transparency
  - ❌ No aggregation with user evidence - AI and user evidence       
  treated separately

  👨‍💼 3. Admin Evidence Review Process

  Current Implementation:
  - Status Field: pending → reviewed → accepted/rejected
  - Quality Scoring: 0-5.0 scale with admin_notes
  - Display Logic: admin_reviewed = (status === 'reviewed' ||        
  status === 'accepted')

  Key Gaps:
  - ❌ No stance marking - admins can't indicate if evidence
  supports/disputes claim
  - ❌ No evidence weighting - all approved evidence treated
  equally
  - ❌ No credibility tracking - user reputation not considered       

  🎨 4. Current Component Structure

  Evidence Resolution Panel has 3 tabs:
  1. Evidence Tab (lines 635-682): Lists user submissions with       
  basic info
  2. AI Engine Tab (lines 685-970): Data source selection + AI       
  analysis results
  3. Aggregate Tab (lines 973-1024): Basic side-by-side 
  comparison only

  Key Limitations:
  - ❌ No smart aggregation - just shows AI vs evidence summaries     
  - ❌ No weighted analysis - equal treatment of all inputs
  - ❌ No stance-based grouping - can't separate supporting vs        
  disputing evidence

  ⚖️ 5. Business Logic Recommendations

  Current State: AI and user evidence are completely independent     
  - no aggregation logic exists.

  Recommended Weighting Strategy:
  Final Confidence = (AI_Weight × AI_Confidence) +
  (Evidence_Weight × Evidence_Score)

  Where:
  - AI_Weight: 0.6-0.8 (higher for NEWS/ACADEMIC, lower for 
  HISTORICAL)
  - Evidence_Weight: 0.2-0.4
  - Evidence_Score: Weighted by quality_score ×
  source_credibility × stance_agreement

  Enhanced Evidence Structure Needed:
  -- Add these fields to evidence_submissions:
  stance VARCHAR CHECK (stance IN ('supporting', 'disputing',        
  'neutral')),
  source_credibility_score DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT 1.0,
  admin_stance_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE

  User Credibility Factors:
  - Submission history (acceptance rate)
  - Quality scores from previous evidence
  - HBAR stake (higher fees = more commitment)
  - Verification status (KYC, reputation)

  🚀 Next Level Implementation Needs:

  1. Evidence Stance Tracking - Support/Dispute/Neutral
  classification
  2. Smart Aggregation Engine - Weighted combination of AI + user    
   evidence
  3. Source Credibility Matrix - Rate academic papers > news >       
  social media
  4. User Reputation System - Track and weight based on
  submission quality
  5. Consensus Algorithm - Handle conflicting evidence
  intelligently

  Your infrastructure is solid but currently treats AI and user      
  evidence as separate islands. The next step is building the        
  bridge between them with intelligent aggregation logic.

# Evidence Aggregation System Implementation Plan

## Current Problem
Your AI engine and user evidence submissions exist as "separate islands" - there's no intelligent way to combine them into a single confidence percentage for market resolution. The admin panel shows AI analysis and user evidence side-by-side, but doesn't aggregate them into actionable certainty metrics for blockchain resolution.

## Solution Overview
Build an intelligent aggregation engine that combines AI analysis confidence with weighted user evidence to produce a final certainty percentage, complete with transparent breakdown for admin review before blockchain submission.

---

## Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement

### Add Evidence Stance Tracking
Currently, your evidence submissions don't track whether they support or dispute the market claim. This is critical missing piece for intelligent aggregation.

**What to Add:**
- **Stance field**: Whether evidence supports, disputes, or is neutral toward the claim
- **Admin stance verification**: Track whether admin has verified the stance assignment
- **Source credibility score**: Rate the quality of evidence sources (academic papers vs social media)

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't aggregate evidence meaningfully without knowing which side it supports
- Enables weighted scoring based on source quality
- Allows admin oversight of stance classification

---

## Phase 2: Smart Aggregation Engine

### Core Algorithm Design
Create a weighted combination system that intelligently merges AI analysis with user evidence submissions.

**Primary Components:**
- **AI Analysis Weight**: 60-70% influence (since your hybrid engine is sophisticated)
- **User Evidence Weight**: 30-40% influence (community-driven verification)
- **Quality Multipliers**: Higher-rated evidence gets more influence
- **Stance Distribution**: Supporting vs disputing evidence creates push-pull dynamics

### Evidence Scoring Logic
Transform user evidence into numerical confidence contribution:

**For Supporting Evidence:**
- High-quality supporting evidence adds to confidence
- Multiple independent supporting sources compound the effect
- Academic/official sources weighted higher than social media

**For Disputing Evidence:**
- High-quality disputing evidence reduces confidence
- Creates healthy skepticism and prevents false positives
- Strong disputing evidence can override weak AI confidence

**For Conflicting Evidence:**
- When evidence strongly conflicts, reduce overall confidence
- Flag for additional admin review
- Prevent false certainty when community is divided

### Source Credibility Matrix
Rate evidence sources on quality and reliability:
- **Academic/Government Sources**: 1.0 multiplier (full weight)
- **Established News/Journalism**: 0.8 multiplier 
- **Verified Expert Opinion**: 0.9 multiplier
- **Social Media/Blogs**: 0.5 multiplier
- **Anonymous/Unverified**: 0.3 multiplier

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Admin Interface

### Improved Evidence Review Workflow
Transform the current basic evidence listing into an intelligent review system.

**During Evidence Review:**
- **Stance Assignment Interface**: Easy dropdown/buttons for admins to classify each evidence as supporting/disputing/neutral
- **Quality Assessment**: Enhanced 0-5.0 scoring with source credibility suggestions
- **Bulk Operations**: Quick approve/classify multiple similar evidence items
- **AI Assistance**: Auto-suggest stance classification based on evidence content analysis

**Real-Time Aggregation Preview:**
- **Live Confidence Calculator**: Shows updated percentage as admin reviews evidence
- **Impact Visualization**: Shows how each evidence item affects the final confidence
- **Transparency Breakdown**: Clear math showing exactly how the percentage was calculated

### Enhanced Aggregate Analysis Tab
Replace the current basic side-by-side comparison with intelligent aggregation:

**Weighted Breakdown Display:**
- **AI Contribution**: "AI Analysis (65%): 82% confident → contributes 53.3 points"
- **Evidence Contribution**: "User Evidence (35%): 6 supporting, 2 disputing → contributes 24.5 points"
- **Final Confidence**: "Overall Certainty: 77.8% → RECOMMEND YES"

**Evidence Summary by Stance:**
- **Supporting Evidence (6 items)**: List with quality scores and credibility ratings
- **Disputing Evidence (2 items)**: List with impact on overall confidence
- **Neutral Evidence (1 item)**: Factual submissions that don't lean either way

**Confidence Factors:**
- **High Confidence Indicators**: Strong AI analysis + multiple high-quality supporting evidence
- **Low Confidence Indicators**: Conflicting evidence + AI uncertainty + poor source quality
- **Risk Flags**: When evidence strongly contradicts AI analysis or when community is deeply divided

---

## Phase 4: User Reputation Integration

### Historical Performance Tracking
Build user credibility scoring based on submission history.

**User Reputation Factors:**
- **Acceptance Rate**: What percentage of their evidence gets approved by admins
- **Quality Track Record**: Average quality scores from previous submissions
- **Stake Commitment**: Higher HBAR submission fees indicate more confidence/commitment
- **Specialization Bonus**: Users with expertise in specific domains get higher weight

**Reputation Multipliers:**
- **Trusted Contributors** (90%+ acceptance rate): 1.2x evidence weight
- **Regular Contributors** (70-89% acceptance): 1.0x evidence weight
- **New/Unproven Users**: 0.8x evidence weight
- **Poor Track Record** (<50% acceptance): 0.5x evidence weight

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Aggregation Features

### Conflict Resolution Logic
Handle cases where AI and user evidence strongly disagree:

**Confidence Reduction Scenarios:**
- **AI says YES (80%), Evidence says NO**: Reduce confidence due to conflict
- **High-Quality Disputing Evidence**: Even small amounts can significantly impact confidence
- **Community Division**: When evidence is roughly 50/50, flag for manual review

**Escalation Triggers:**
- **Major AI/Evidence Conflict**: Difference >30% triggers admin notification
- **High-Stakes Markets**: Markets with large HBAR pools get extra scrutiny
- **Controversial Topics**: Historical/political topics get conservative confidence scoring

### Transparency and Auditability
Ensure every confidence calculation is explainable and reviewable:

**Audit Trail:**
- **Calculation Breakdown**: Store exactly how each percentage was derived
- **Evidence Chain**: Link each confidence component to specific evidence/analysis
- **Admin Overrides**: Track when admins manually adjust confidence levels
- **Historical Versions**: Keep record of how confidence changed as evidence was added
