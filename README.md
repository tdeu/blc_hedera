## 📈 Roadmap & Development Status

### **✅ COMPLETED COMPONENTS**
- ✅ **Evidence Collection System**: Real HBAR payments, Supabase storage, economic incentives
- ✅ **AI Resolution Engine**: Comprehensive BlockCast AI Agent with multi-language support
- ✅ **Market UI/UX**: Status badges, dispute interfaces, conditional actions
- ✅ **External Data Framework**: Mock integrations with news/government APIs ready
- ✅ **Hedera Integration**: Smart contracts deployed, HCS topics configured

### **❌ CRITICAL MISSING COMPONENTS**

#### **🚨 Priority 1: Market Lifecycle Automation**
```typescript
// MISSING: Automatic market expiry detection & AI resolution trigger
// CURRENT: Markets stay active indefinitely
// NEED: Scheduler to check expired markets → trigger AI resolution
// FILES: marketMonitorService.ts (gap at lifecycle automation)
```

#### **🚨 Priority 2: Betting System Backend**
```typescript
// MISSING: Actual betting functionality with real payments
// CURRENT: UI shows "place prediction" but no smart contract calls
// NEED: Integration with CONTRACT_PREDICTION_MARKET_FACTORY
// FILES: Need betting service integration
```

#### **🚨 Priority 3: AI-to-Execution Pipeline**
```typescript
// MISSING: Bridge between AI decisions and smart contract execution
// CURRENT: AI makes decisions but doesn't execute them on-chain
// NEED: Connect blockcastAIAgent → contract resolution calls
// FILES: Missing resolution execution service
```

#### **🔧 Priority 4: External Data Sources**
```typescript
// MISSING: Real API integrations for trusted sources
// CURRENT: Mock data in ai-market-resolution.ts
// NEED: BBC API, Reuters, government portals integration
// FILES: External data service implementation
```

### **📊 Current System Analysis**

#### **What Works (Complete Implementation):**
- **Evidence Collection**: Full blockchain payment flow with economic incentives
- **AI Decision Making**: Sophisticated multi-language analysis with confidence scoring
- **UI/UX Flow**: Status-based market cards with proper dispute interfaces
- **Database Layer**: Complete schema for markets, evidence, disputes, resolutions

#### **What's Missing (Critical Gaps):**
1. **Market Expiry → AI Resolution Pipeline**: No automation between stages
2. **Betting System**: Users can't place actual Y/N predictions with payments
3. **Resolution Execution**: AI decisions don't trigger smart contract payouts
4. **External Verification**: No real-world data source integrations

### **🎯 Development Priorities (Next 2-4 Weeks)**

#### **Week 1: Core Pipeline**
- ✅ Fix market expiry detection automation
- ✅ Connect AI agent to market lifecycle
- ✅ Implement betting system backend

#### **Week 2: Integration**
- ✅ AI resolution → smart contract execution
- ✅ External data source integration (BBC, Reuters APIs)
- ✅ End-to-end testing of complete flow

#### **Week 3: Enhancement**
- ✅ Multi-language evidence processing
- ✅ Advanced confidence scoring
- ✅ Community reputation system

#### **Week 4: Production Readiness**
- ✅ Load balancing and performance optimization
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- ✅ Mobile app development
