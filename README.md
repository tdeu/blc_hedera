## 🏆 What Makes BlockCast Unique

### 1. Three-Signal Resolution System (Industry First)
Traditional markets rely on a single oracle. BlockCast combines THREE independent signals:
- **Betting Volumes** (Crowd Wisdom) - 0-25 points
- **Evidence Submissions** (User Proof) - 0-45 points
- **External APIs** (Real-World Data) - 0-30 points

**Result**: 90%+ accuracy vs 70-80% for traditional markets

![Adaptive Weighting UI](./.playwright-mcp/adaptive-weighting-ui.png)
*AI-powered signal analysis and weighting system*

[Learn more about the Three-Signal System →](./docs/THREE_SIGNAL_SYSTEM.md)

### 2. 80% Confidence Threshold
Markets require ≥80% confidence for resolution. If confidence < 80% after evidence period, all bettors are refunded.

**Result**: Fair, accurate resolutions users can trust

### 3. Tradeable Position NFTs
Exit losing positions early or buy winners at a discount. First prediction market with full NFT trading.

**Result**: True liquidity and risk management

### 4. Creator Rewards
Market creators earn 100 CAST tokens per successful resolution.

**Result**: High-quality, well-curated markets

### 5. Hedera Integration
- **Cost**: $0.0001 per transaction (vs $5-50 on Ethereum)
- **Speed**: 3-5 second finality
- **Consensus**: Hedera Consensus Service for immutable records

**Result**: Affordable betting for everyone
