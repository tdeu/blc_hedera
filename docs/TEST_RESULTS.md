## What Each Component Does

### Resolution Flow:
1. **`resolutionService.preliminaryResolveMarket()`**
   - Calls `preliminaryResolve()` on smart contract
   - Uses **admin signer** (not user's wallet)
   - Sets 7-day dispute period
   - Updates database to "disputable"

2. **`resolutionService.finalResolveMarket()`**
   - Calls `finalResolve()` with confidence score
   - Uses **admin signer**
   - Updates database to "resolved"
   - **Triggers bet resolution** via `betResolutionService`

3. **`betResolutionService.updateBetsForResolvedMarket()`**
   - Updates all user bets for the market
   - Sets status to 'won' or 'lost'
   - Calculates `actualWinning` amounts
   - Stores in localStorage

### Claiming Flow:
1. **Portfolio loads** → Syncs bets with database
2. **User sees P&L** → Shows unclaimed winnings
3. **User clicks "Claim"** → Calls `redeem()` on market contract
4. **Smart contract** → Transfers CAST tokens to user's wallet
5. **localStorage updated** → Marks as claimed
6. **Balance refreshes** → User sees their tokens
